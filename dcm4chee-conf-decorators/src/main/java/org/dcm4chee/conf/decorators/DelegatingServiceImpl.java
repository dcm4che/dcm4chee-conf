 * 1) getTypeObject() method works because the DelegatingXXService classes we have all extend this class with an explicit type T
 * 2) I would have preferred to have the set/get methods be final, but WELD needs to extend the class for its proxies so that can't be done
 * 3) CDI needs an empty constructor - initially tried to have a constructor that passed in the orig value, but this wouldn't allow the class to be injected
 *		-> could get around the empty constructor requirement by using a producer
